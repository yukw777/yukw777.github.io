Hello there! My name is Keunwoo Peter Yu (I usually go by my middle name Peter), and I'm an applied scientist at Wayve. I currently focus on building foundation models for autonomous vehicles. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the Unviersity of Michigan focusing on multimodal models and embodied AI. Specifically, I researched vision-language models for videos and how they can be effectively used in real-time, embodied settings. Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I worked as a software engineer specializing in distributed, real-time systems.
