Hello there! My name is Keunwoo Peter Yu (I usually go by my middle name Peter), and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Unviersity of Michigan. My current research focus is multimodal models and embodied AI. Specifically, I'm interested in vision-language models for videos and how they can be effectively used in real-time, embodied settings. Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I worked as a software engineer specializing in distributed, real-time systems.
